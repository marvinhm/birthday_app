# Birthday App

We are building a web app that will ask the user for a name and birthday.

When the user submits the form, and depending on the current date, the app will either:
- wish the user happy birthday
- tell them how long they'll have to wait until their next birthday



### Tech

* [Ruby/ERB] - For logic and HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [Capybara] - test automation software that simulates scenarios and automates web application testing for BDD
* [Sinatra] - a DSL for quickly creating web applications in Ruby with minimal effort
* [RSpec] - For unit testing purposes.
